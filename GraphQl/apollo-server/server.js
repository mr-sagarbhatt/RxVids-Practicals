/**
 * Your GraphQL server uses a schema to describe the shape of your available data. This schema defines a hierarchy of types with fields that are populated from your back-end data stores.
 * Most of the types you define in a GraphQL schema are object types. An object type contains a collection of fields, each of which has its own type.
 * The Query type is a special object type that defines all of the top-level entry points for queries that clients execute against your server.
 * The Mutation type is similar in structure and purpose to the Query type. Whereas the Query type defines entry points for read operations, the Mutation type defines entry points for write operations.
 * Each field of the Mutation type defines the signature and return type of a different entry point.
